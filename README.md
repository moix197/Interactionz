# Interactionz
This is a library to make interactions inside a webpage easy.

You can create many things with interacionz like: Sidebars, Modals, Accordions, Sliders, Page scrolls.

Interactionz also does nice stuff like:
Changing your elements colors or text on hover or click of the same element or any other, handling your URLS, and many other nice stuff.
